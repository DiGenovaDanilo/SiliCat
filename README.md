#SiliCat: a framework for studying silicate melts

SiliCat allows you to access viscosity and Raman spectroscopy databases. It further provides an easy way to use common viscosity, heat capacity and other density models.

The large database further allows using Machine Learning technics to predict various parameters for new compositions.

## Introduction

SiliCat is a project consisting in database of silicate melts properties and spectroscopic data, linked to models and machine learning algorithms.

SiliCat aims to provide an easy, portable and centralized access to published dataasets. We further publish this framework as an open-source project, with the aim to receive contributions in order to keep the databases and models up to date. The starting point of SiliCat is silicate melts, but we have no limitation and can include other database (metallic melts, etc.), depending on the contributions of other people. THe final aim of SiliCat will be to be a useful tool for studying the relationships between the properties and the structure of liquids, with easy bindings to existing and new models, in order to promote new scientific discoveries.
